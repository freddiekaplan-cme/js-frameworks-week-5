## What I Learned

It was fun building after a mockup style, and I had a great time coming up with names. I spent a lot of time on css and small adjustments. At this time I was still adjusting to working with React and using the useState hook correctly. While not fully responsove, I added a few media queries and a message if the display is to small to show the site.

# JavaScript Frameworks Assignment 5

Simple portfolio site assignment using Next js. Easter egg: Double click on the Home button.

## What I Used

-   CSS
-   Dynamic routing
-   ESlint
-   Next js
-   Not found function
-   NPM packages
-   Prettier
-   UseState

## What I Learned

Another course, another portfolio site. This one is made with Next though, which I really like. It feels like React on steroids and you can do so much. This assignment really felt like working with modern web development in a more professional way, using Prettier and ESlint and casually throwing in a NPM package for the contact form.
